To test rate limiting on this application

1) First run "go mod tidy" to install all dependencies

2) Then in the main.go directory run "go run ." to start the server

3) Install "hey": "go install github.com/rakyll/hey@latest"

4) Run "hey -n 100 -c 10 http://<ENDPOINT>:8080/events

Locally I yielded results where 90 of the 100 reponses were blocked with code "429" which indicates that rate limiting is working.
